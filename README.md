<h1>Points to improve in Future</h1>
<p>• Threading can be improved to allow huge number of real time requests.</p>
<p>• This can be converted into an API with proper swagger as AccountTransactionsService.</p>
<p>• We can connect with DataBase and use cache (like Redis) to improve performance.</p>
<p>• Transactionality has to be handled properly to keep consistency of the data.</p>
<p>• Notification service can use spring-actuator for real time alerts in production.</p>
